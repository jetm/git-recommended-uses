# Who am I to talk about Git?

* Using Git professionally since 2011.

* Developed tools around Git: repo tool, WSSW Git Hooks and various little
utilities.

* Migrated severals projects to Git from Clearcase, CVS and Subversion.

* Solved hundreds of issues related to Git. Today I still do it, but no
hundreds ðŸ˜Š.

# Why Git Recommended Uses?

* By my experience, I have seen smart people struggle while are learning Git.

* Git is a powerful tool, but it has some hard hills to climb.

* At the beginning Git there was a poor documentation with severals ways to get same
result.

* Git is not Subversion. Git redefined how to use a Control Version software and
the world was used to Centralized approach.

???

When are too many options, usually you get confused.

With each Git release the documentation is getting better, but still are the
options to get same result..

# Expectations

* Not much, just one: I expect from this presentation you can take some
knowledge and apply it to your frequent Git routine.

# Little Git History

* Created 10 years ago (2005) by Linus Torvalds.

* Meaning git: "unpleasant person". Torvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard,
and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."

* Git arrived as a necessity after close accesses of Linux kernel developers to
BitKeeper (SCM). Torvalds released the first Git version and the world of
Control Version software started to change.
