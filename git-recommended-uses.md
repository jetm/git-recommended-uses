# Who am I to talk about Git?

* Using Git professionally since 2011.

* Developed tools around Git: repo tool, WSSW Git Hooks and various little
utilities.

* Migrated severals projects to Git from Clearcase, CVS and Subversion.

* Solved hundreds of issues helping people using Git. Today I still do it, but
 no hundreds ðŸ˜Š.

# Why Git Recommended Uses?

1. People struggle while are learning Git.

2. Git is a powerful tool, but it has some hard hills to climb.

3. At the beginning poor documentation and severals ways to get same result.

4. Git is not Subversion.

???

1. By experience I have seen many smart people struggle while are learning Git.
Some people compare Git with Hitler.

2. When are too many options, usually you get confused.

3. With each Git release the documentation is getting better, but still are the
options to get same result..

4. Git redefined how to use a Control Version software and the world was used
to Centralized approach. It's not Subversion, but it can be used similar.

# Expectations

# Introduction

### * Little Git History

### * Why Git and no another SCM

# Little Git History

* Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds and maintained by Junio Hamano.

* Meaning git: "unpleasant person".

* Git arrived as a necessity.

???

* Created 10 years ago, patches and many contributors and thousands contributions.

* Torvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after
myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."

* After close accesses of Linux kernel developers to BitKeeper (SCM). Torvalds
released the first Git version and the world of Control Version software
started to change.

# Why Git and no another SCM

** PUT HERE GRAPHIC SCM COMPARISON **

???

* Git won SCM war.

* When Torvalds designed Git, he already has experience with BitKeeper in the big
Linux Kernel code base. He studied all defects of CVS, Subversion, Darcs,
Baazar, Monotone and others.

* Be distributed, simple designed, making quickly and clean merges, all together
was a big deal on that time.

# Use latest Git version

> ### $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
> ### $ sudo apt-get update
> ### $ sudo apt-get install git

???

Assuming Ubuntu default Distribution.

Problem to solve:

> Ubuntu has a Git version is not updated frequently.

Normally, people has fears to update software due to avoid a 'possible'
breakdown system. Others are just lazy people. Git code has a strong Test Suite
with thousands test cases.

In all these years using Git, I have never lost information for update to the
latest Git version.
