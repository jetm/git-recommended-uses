# Why Git Recommended Uses?

1. People struggle while are learning Git.

2. Git is a powerful tool, but it has some hard hills to climb.

3. At the beginning poor documentation and severals ways to get same result.

4. Git is not Subversion.

???

1. By experience I have seen many smart people struggle while are learning Git.
Some people compare Git with Hitler.

2. When are too many options, usually you get confused.

3. With each Git release the documentation is getting better, but still are the
options to get same result..

4. Git redefined how to use a Control Version software and the world was used
to Centralized approach. It's not Subversion, but it can be used similar.

# Expectations

your frequent Git routine.

???

Just one expectation.

# Little Git History

* Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds and maintained by Junio Hamano.

* Meaning git: "unpleasant person".

* Git arrived as a necessity.

???

* Created 10 years ago, patches and many contributors and thousands contributions.

* Torvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after
myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."

* After close accesses of Linux kernel developers to BitKeeper (SCM). Torvalds
released the first Git version and the world of Control Version software
started to change.
